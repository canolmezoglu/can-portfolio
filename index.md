**[Graph Isomorphism and Automorphism Counter](https://github.com/canolmezoglu/2021_module7_group37_handin)**

_A Python program to count the number of automorphisms of a graph or isomorphisms between graphs.          
The algorithm is based on AHU to calculate isomorphisms and automorphisms in subquadratic time
Ideas from Hopcroftâ€™s minimization algorithm were used to color refine graphs more efficiently
In a University of Twente based competition, the program was in the 95th percentile with receiving a perfect score.
Following the success of the project, I served as a teaching assistant for the next year._

**[ECRF Hospital Data Storage System](/pdf/gg.pdf)**

_A web application to store and analyze COVID data based on a 3 tier architecture
